In the quietude of twilight's tender sigh,
A tale unfolds, a feline friend says goodbye.
Willie, multicolored, a quilt of delight,
Silently departed, a beacon in the night.

Fourteen years adorned in hues so grand,
A whiskered companion, in the soft moonlight's hand.
Through sunlit days and the shadows that climb,
She leaped through your window, one last time.

Rarely did she meow, a gentle, quiet grace,
Yet, in her silence, a familiar embrace.
Her final leap, a poignant ballet,
Through the window, to the stars, she'd convey.

In your arms, she found her tranquil repose,
As the night's gentle breeze tenderly flows.
Her multicolored coat, a celestial flare,
In the cosmic tapestry, she'll forever share.

A symphony of memories, a purr's soft refrain,
In the gentle cradle of love's enduring domain.
She jumped through your window, a celestial climb,
Into the stardust, beyond the hands of time.

In the quiet hours, where tears softly start,
Willie, dear friend, etched in your heart.
Fourteen years, a bond never to sever,
In the vast expanse, she'll live on forever.
