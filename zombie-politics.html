In a system that reduces life to a chain of disconnected reactions to shock, personal com­
munication tends to lose all meaning... .The individual under terrorist conditions is never
alone and always alone. I-Ie becomes numb and rigid not only in relation to his neighbor but
also in relation to himself; fear robs him of the power of spontaneous emotional or mental
reaction. Thinking becomes a stupid crime; it endangers his life. The inevitable conse­
quence is that stupidity spreads as a contagious disease among the terrorized population.
Human beings live in a state of stupor, in a moral coma.
