So now it's the very companies out for the little guy who are in fact fucking the little guy the hardest.  Without their consent mind you.  Coinbase is a pathetic hunk of greedy cocksuckers.  And not the
cocksuckers who fondle your balls.  These are ones who bite.  And bite hard.  Then they kick you in the balls.  Motherfuckers, one and all.  They will charge 75 cents to make a purchase or sale of a crypto
if the sale is 1 million dollars.  But they will charge me 5.00 to trade $50.00.  What the fuck?

This is just one of the worst.  Not unique.  All large companies are evil.  They all do more harm than good.  Monopolies are un-American.  Yet very "American".

Aug 10, 2023.  My humble opinion.  What power goes money?  Unfortunately, almost all.  Which portends the Human race in lowercase.  Quite literally, humans suck.  When we are pressed, we bite rather than reach out.  Fear everything we don't know.  Kill most things we do know.  We pray to money, gold in particular.  Now it's gotten to the point where the fucking 'haves' don't give flying fuck about everyone else.  Fuck them and the security state in America.  The US is hiding technology which could transform the World.  Selfishly.  Like that Van Der fuck back in the 1950's who knew UFO's were extra terrestrial but lied about it when asked.  Project just before project bluebook.  2 year study and he burned it.  Fuck you Van Der Dickhead.

Today, a war in Ukraine rages on.  Putin to blame.  Yet, the West as well gets 1/3rd because we could have nipped this in the bud and chose not to.  Chose.  Just like choosing not to resolve the Chinese issues.  Discussions are for the poor.  The rich use their money to do their talking.  And fuck all them.  Every fucking one of them.  Fuck em.

Now, let's talk about Washington Post (idiot cavemen and women).  The military industrial complex with their boney and grubby money hungry fuckers.  Taking my tax dollars then lie, lie, lie.  Fucking the American people without asking.  Mother-fuckers one and all.

Now, let's talk about the cocksucking NY Times.  Ya, arrogant mother-fuckers.  How about those idiots with the military?  Always looking for a nail with their big fucking hammers.  All over the World.  Picking fights to show off their tools from the far future.
