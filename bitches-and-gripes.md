So now it's the very companies out for the little guy who are in fact fucking the little guy the hardest.  Without their consent mind you.  Coinbase is a pathetic hunk of greedy cocksuckers.  And not the
cocksuckers who fondle your balls.  These are ones who bite.  And bite hard.  Then they kick you in the balls.  Motherfuckers, one and all.  They will charge 75 cents to make a purchase or sale of a crypto
if the sale is 1 million dollars.  But they will charge me 5.00 to trade $50.00.  What the fuck?

This is just one of the worst.  Not unique.  All large companies are evil.  They all do more harm than good.  Monopolies are un-American.  Yet very "American".
