      Let's not forget the fucking morons in the military. They believed and still believe they are the end-all, be-all. That is such horseshit.
      Inherited and believed they deserved this inheritance. Fuck off. Egos are beyond belief. Explain anything you 'know' to a 6-year-old. Not
      possible with any of these idiots. I'm ashamed to be an American because of these ass-holes. Arrogant fucks. Expecially MIC. You are not
      the smartest, wisest, or most capable. You AREN'T! Period. FOAD.  And don't forget to D!" />

                <h2 class="post-title">Who Started the Cold War?</h2>
                <h3 class="post-subtitle">12 Mar '47 - 26 Dec '91 (44 years &amp; 9 months)
                </h3>
		<h3 class="post-subtitle">Truman started the cold war, Russia ended it<br>
		  The Cold War began with the announcement of the Truman Doctrine in 1947, 
		  and ended with Mikhail Gorbachev's three contributions;<br>
		  1) The first was to remove its ideological foundations. In a break with 
		  Soviet Marxism-Leninism, Gorbachev called in 1988 for a “deideologization 
		  of interstate relations” and argued for priority to be given to values and 
		  interests that united the whole of humanity rather than those of any one 
		  class, nation or group. These included “the worldwide ecological threats” 
		  which, ahead of most Western leaders, he declared in his 1988 speech at the 
		  United Nations to be “simply frightening.”<br>
		  2) The second crucial contribution to ending the Cold War was his embrace of 
		  fundamental change of the Soviet political system and Soviet society. The new 
		  tolerance within the Soviet Union itself—from an end to persecution of religion 
		  to a burgeoning freedom of speech and, before long, of publication reduced the 
		  sense of Soviet threat. When Gorbachev announced in 1988 that the following year 
		  there would be contested elections for a new legislature, this was a decisive 
		  step toward making the political system different in kind.<br>
		  3) Gorbachev’s third fundamental contribution to ending the Cold War was his 
		  recognition that means in politics are as important as ends, and that included 
		  his commitment to change by peaceful means. The former head of Soviet Space 
		  Research, Roald Sagdeev, who emigrated to the U.S. in 1989, remarked on Gorbachev’s 
		  faith in persuasion, and how this, too, differentiated him from previous Soviet 
		  political bosses who would just issue an order and expect to have it obeyed.<br>
		  Now, on the other end of the spectrum was Ronald Reagan (Bush, Sr notably from CIA fame). 
		  Funding lasers, star wars, and so many more deadly weapons and secretive policies 
		  (funding more than doubled under his eight-year administration).<br>
		  All this funding of military and deadly weapons. With no 'real' enemy.

                  Every gun that is made, every warship launched,<br>
                  every rocket fired signifies, in the final sense,<br>
                  a theft from those who hunger and are not fed, <br>
