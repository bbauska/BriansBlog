              <h2 class="post-title">Prescott Bush &amp; Smedley Butler</h2>
              <h3 class="post-subtitle">Plot to overthrow the US government<br>
                The “Business Plot” a self-described fascist conspiracy to overthrow FDR. 
				Fascism did not yet have the bad reputation it does now. Many people saw 
				it as a viable alternative to Capitalism with its wild swings between bust 
				and boom. Roosevelt’s policies helped slow the swings to a more manageable 
				level.
				<br>
                Conservative businessmen are horrified by FDR economic policies.
                "This is despotism, this is tyranny, this is the annihilation of liberty," 
				one senator [Republican Senator Henry D. Hatfield] wrote to a colleague. 
				"The ordinary American is thus reduced to the status of a robot. The 
				president has not merely signed the death warrant of capitalism, but 
				has ordained the mutilation of the Constitution, unless the friends of 
				liberty, regardless of party, band themselves together to regain their 
				lost freedom."
				<h4>When The Bankers Plotted To Overthrow FDR</h4>
                Allegedly there were plans to attempt a coup to overthrow and replace 
				Roosevelt during the depression by business interests in 1934.
                <br>
                The evidence of the scheme was real. What is unknown is whether the idea 
				was wishful thinking hatched over cocktails or a real conspiracy.
                The plotters were said to have recruited a retired Marine, Major General 
				Smedley Butler to lead the coup. Butler was a patriot who appeared to go 
				along with the plot then exposed the scheme.<br>
                At the time of the incident, news media at first reported on the plot 
				earnestly, then quickly changed course and dismissed the plot. For 
				instance, The New York Times newsroom gave the plot front-page coverage 
				until a New York Times editorial characterized it as a "gigantic hoax”. 
				While historians have questioned how close the coup actually got to 
				execution, most agree that some sort of "wild scheme" was contemplated 
				and discussed.<br>
                Roosevelt's election was upsetting for many conservative businessmen of 
				the time, as his "campaign promise that the government would provide jobs 
				for all the unemployed had the perverse effect of creating a new wave of 
				unemployment by businessmen frightened by fears of socialism and reckless 
				government spending."<br>
                Some historians have said concerns over the gold standard were also 
				involved; Jules Archer, in The Plot to Seize the White House, wrote that 
				with the end of the gold standard, "conservative financiers were horrified. 
				They viewed a currency not solidly backed by gold as inflationary, 
				undermining both private and business fortunes and leading to national 
				bankruptcy. Roosevelt was damned as a socialist or Communist out to 
				destroy private enterprise by sapping the gold backing of wealth in order 
				to subsidize the poor."<br>
                During the McCormack–Dickstein Committee hearings Butler testified that 
				Gerald C. MacGuire attempted to recruit him to lead a coup, promising him 
				an army of 500,000 men for a march on Washington, DC, and financial 
				backing. Butler testified that the pretext for the coup would be that the 
				president's health was failing.<br>
                Despite Butler's support for Roosevelt in the election and his reputation 
				as a strong critic of capitalism, Butler said the plotters felt his good 
				reputation and popularity were vital in attracting support amongst the 
				general public and saw him as easier to manipulate than others. Given a 
				successful coup, Butler said that the plan was for him to have held near-
				absolute power in the newly created position of "Secretary of General 
				Affairs", while Roosevelt would have assumed a figurehead role.<br>
                In 1936 William Dodd, the U.S. Ambassador to Germany, wrote a letter to 
				President Roosevelt in which he stated, A clique of U.S. industrialists 
				is hell-bent to bring a fascist state to supplant our democratic government 
				and is working closely with the fascist regime in Germany and Italy. I 
				have had plenty of opportunity in my post in Berlin to witness how close 
				some of our American ruling families are to the Nazi regime. ... A 
				prominent executive of one of the largest corporations, told me point 
				blank that he would be ready to take definite action to bring fascism 
				into America if President Roosevelt continued his progressive policies. 
				Certain American industrialists had a great deal to do with bringing 
				fascist regimes into being in both Germany and Italy. They extended aid 
				to help Fascism occupy the seat of power, and they are helping to keep it 
				there. Propagandists for fascist groups try to dismiss the fascist scare. 
				We should be aware of the symptoms. When industrialists ignore laws 
				designed for social and economic progress they will seek recourse to a 
				fascist state when the institutions of our government compel them to 
				comply with the provisions.<br>
                Pulitzer Prize-winning historian Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr. said, "Most 
				people agreed with Mayor La Guardia of New York in dismissing it as a 
				'cocktail putsch'." In Schlesinger's summation of the affair, "No doubt, 
				MacGuire did have some wild scheme in mind, though the gap between 
				contemplation and execution was considerable, and it can hardly be 
				supposed that the Republic was in much danger."<br>
                Robert F. Burk wrote, "At their core, the accusations probably consisted 
				of a mixture of actual attempts at influence peddling by a small core of 
				financiers with ties to veterans organizations and the self-serving 
				accusations of Butler against the enemies of his pacifist and populist 
				causes."<br>
                Hans Schmidt wrote, "Even if Butler was telling the truth, as there seems 
				little reason to doubt, there remains the unfathomable problem of 
				MacGuire's motives and veracity. He may have been working both ends 
				against the middle, as Butler at one point suspected. In any case, 
				MacGuire emerged from the HUAC hearings as an inconsequential trickster 
				whose base dealings could not possibly be taken alone as verifying such a 
				momentous undertaking. If he was acting as an intermediary in a genuine 
				probe, or as agent provocateur sent to fool Butler, his employers were at 
				least clever enough to keep their distance and see to it that he self-
				destructed on the witness stand."</h3>

              <h3 class="post-subtitle">The Bush Family Dynasty and Prescott Bush’s Love 
			  Affair with Fascism<br>
			  I was involved in pro-peace, anti-war, anti-US Imperialism efforts during 
			  the most hideous years of the Reagan/Bush administrations (from 1980–1992) 
			  that resulted in the deaths and sufferings of millions of innocent people 
			  in virtually every South and Central American nation you can think of.<br>
			  <br>
              As I remember the many innocent – often “disappeared” - war-refugees who 
			  suffered, starved and died at the hands of my war-profiteering national 
			  leaders, I am unable to shed any tears for the guilty ones, even if they 
			  are now dead or dying, for they were war-mongers that never apologized for 
			  their misdeeds. They were members beholden to Wall Street and War Street 
			  whose intentions made them responsible for brutal massacres, assassinations, 
			  torturing, mass killings, starvation and the impoverishment of millions of 
			  innocents that wanted to live in peace in their homeland that had been 
			  targeted for exploitation by my once-beloved homeland.<br>
              <br>
              When our past history of US-inflicted economic and military cruelty is 
			  forgotten (or never learned in the first place, as is the case of our 
			  current president), our people and politicians can’t make the connections 
			  between 1) America’s Wall Street and War Street exploitation of the rest of
			  the world and 2) the current global crises of Big Business-induced global 
			  warming, Wall Street-induced economic disparities/oppression/refugees and 
			  War Street’s perpetual wars that have been going all over the planet since 
			  the Reagan/Bush administrations went into deep debt by lavishing trillions 
			  of dollars on America’s military, nuclear weapons and its conventional 
			  arsenals.<br>
			  <br>
              I know that many of my readers also grew tired of the endless accolades for 
			  ex-president George Herbert Walker Bush (US President # 41) who died 
			  Novermber 30, 2018 at 94. Having to endure listening to the repetitive 
			  accounts of the small handful of good and decent things that he was given 
			  credit for made me turn off the radio and TV for that week. One such 
			  accolade that was particularly undeserved was his signing – not authoring 
			  or proposing or even politicking for - the Americans with Disabilities Act 
			  of 1990. There are many points that need to be made when powerful US 
			  leaders die, especially presidents. But the accolades need to be balanced 
			  with what are often unwelcome truths. And, in my opinion, that balance 
			  needs to be applied particularly to those leaders that have been 
			  legitimately accused of being guilty of crimes against the peace, 
			  international war crimes or war-profiteering.<br>
              Therefore, presidents and other national leaders that have been war-mongers, 
			  serial liars, sociopaths, narcissists, megalomaniacs, greed-heads or simply 
			  traitors to democratic ideals are particularly deserving of scorn – not 
			  accolades - even if they are recently deceased. I recall cringing as I 
			  listened to the endless accolades given to pro-war presidents like Lyndon 
			  Johnson, Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan in the lead-up to their funerals. 
			  And I know that I will have to think twice before I mourn the inevitable 
			  deaths of our living but unrepentant, war-mongering presidents and their 
			  advisors (everyone since Carter?). If I had been aware years ago, I also 
			  wouldn’t have mourned the deaths of the many evil-doers that were behind 
			  the fascist “Business Plot” to overthrow Franklin Delano Roosevelt in 1934 
			  (see details in the two articles at the end of this piece).<br>
              One of the “Business Plot” coup-plotters was banker Prescott Bush, the 
			  father of George H W Bush and grandfather of George W Bush. None of 
			  Prescott Bush’s progeny have been willing to talk about Prescott’s 
			  traitorous deeds. At the time of the plot, Prescott Bush was deeply 
			  involved in the business of the Hamburg-America Lines (co-owned by 
			  industrialists from both pro-Hitler Germany and pro-Hitler America). Bush 
			  was also involved in the ascendance of Adolf Hitler to his becoming dictator 
			  in 1933. Prescott Bush was slated to be the liaison between the coup-plotting 
			  group and Hitler’s new regime. The defeat of the Democrat FDR in his runs for 
			  re-election were important goals. The attempt to defeat FDR in the 1940 
			  re-election campaign was actually heavily-funded by Nazi Germany. (A 
			  reminder of the alleged Russian involvement in defeating Hillary Clinton.) 
			  Prescott Bush became an FDR-hating Republican US Senator from Connecticut 
			  who must have been privately ambivalent about going to war against his old 
			  allies in Germany. Another irony is that Prescott’s son George H W Bush 
			  became a World War II war hero – albeit in the Pacific war against Japan. 
			  For much more on Prescott Bush’s deep involvement with the Third Reich, 
			  including Nazi Germany’s efforts to defeat FDR in his re-election campaign 
			  in 1940, go to http://spitfirelist.com/for-the-record/ftr-475-pryor-offenses/   
			  For a good source of information on the Bush family, including the 
			  “Business Plot” against FDR, read Russ Baker’s book:<br>
              The Bush Dynasty, the Powerful Forces That Put It in the White House, and 
			  What Their Influence Means for America   Some of the Unmentionables in 
			  George H W Bush’s Legacy.<br>
              I’m certain that many of us aware of the many omissions concerning the 
			  legacy of George H W Bush. I list some of them below:
			  <ol start="1">
			    <li>Bush 41’s veto of the Civil Rights Act of 1990;</li>
                <li>His nefarious actions while he was CIA chief in Gerald Ford’s administration;</li>
                <li>His role in the US support of the uncountable South and Central American 
				  dictatorships during the Reagan administration;</li>
                <li>The illegal invasion of Panama (Operation Just Cause!);</li>
                <li>Starting the un-provoked Persian Gulf War;</li>
                <li>His Christmas Eve pardoning of former defense secretary Caspar W. 
				  Weinberger, Elliot Abrams and four other government officials that 
				  were involved in the Iran-Contra affair;</li>
                <li>His complicity in the thousands of corpses that rotted on the Highway 
				  of Death in Iraq in 1991;</li>
                <li>His playing the “race card” in the use of Willie Horton in the Dukakis 
				  campaign;</li>
                <li>Bush 41 and the CIA’s role in the Contra War-era’s flooding of the US 
			     with crack cocaine that facilitated the epidemic that has persisted to 
				 this day;</li>
               <li>His appointment of Clarence Thomas to the Supreme Court;</li>
               <li>The intentional targeting of the air-raid shelter in Baghdad that 
			     killed over 400 Iraqi civilians;</li>
               <li>A host of other items. Just google Bush plus: a) Operation Black Eagle; 
			     b) Oliver North; c) El Salvador; d) Nicaragua; e) Honduras; f) Felix 
				 Rodriguez; g) etc, etc, Oh, and there was also no mention of </li>
			   <li>His admitted groping of at least 8 young women – acts that brought 
			     down in disgrace many of his contemporaries.</li>
			   </ol>
               (NOTE: The Iran-Contra affair, referred to above, was an illegal action 
			   that Bush was involved in when he was VP under Reagan. It was likewise 
			   never mentioned by any mainstream media outlet that I heard that week. 
			   Because of US congressional laws prohibiting the continued use of US 
			   taxpayer dollars to fund the right-wing Contra “rebels” that were fighting 
			   against various left-leaning nations in Central America, the Reagan/Bush 
			   administration secretly and illegally raised the money to keep the 
			   Contra’s terrorist operations going by selling missiles to Iran in 
			   exchange for the release of American hostages. They then used the illicit 
			   money from those weapons sales to illegally fund the Contras in Nicaragua, 
			   Honduras and surrounding areas, an action which was forbidden by Congress. 
			   Oliver North was one of the point men in the illegal operation.)<br>
               In the 101st Congress (during the first 2 years of Bush 41’s presidency), 
			   Democrats had sizable majorities of 55/45 in the Senate and 251/183 in the 
			   House of Representatives. It was during that time that the Exxon-Valdez 
			   Oil Spill occurred. The Big Oilman Bush surely collaborated in the 
			   mishandling, the cover-up and the failure to punish Exxon justly. 
			   The capture, imprisonment (in a US prison!) and silencing of one of Bush 
			   41’s many military dictator buddies, Panama’s Manuel Noriega. Military 
			   strongman Noriega was a CIA intelligence asset and paid informant during 
			   the time when Bush 41 was CIA Director (1976 - 1977), which was just one 
			   more motivating factor in the deceptively labeled “Operation Just Cause”.<br>
               Another major motivation for the Panama invasion – during which uncounted 
			   numbers of innocent Panamanian civilians were killed by the US troops - 
			   was the fact that both Wall Street and War Street had been upset with 
			   President Jimmy Carter’s 1977 treaty with Panama. That treaty promised to 
			   gradually relinquish US control over the Canal Zone and gradually eliminate 
			   US military bases by the year 2000. The Bush invasion ultimately didn’t 
			   reverse the treaty as probably intended, and all US military installations 
			   were eventually handed over to Panama in late 1999 – much to the 
			   dissatisfaction of powerful economic and military elites. Operation Just 
			   Cause was not authorized by the Democratic Party-controlled Congress. But 
			   there was a lot of progressive legislation that came to Bush’s Oval Office 
			   desk for his signature during his term, and he had little choice but to 
			   sign most of it.<br>
			   (See a partial list of the legislation at: 
			   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/101st_United_States_Congress).
